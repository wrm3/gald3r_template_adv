description: Code review — security, quality, performance, reusability. Structured report with severity ratings and action items. Scales from quick scan to comprehensive architecture review.

# g-skl-code-review

**Activate for**: `@g-code-review`, `@g-code-review`, "review this code", "check before commit", "PR review", security scan, quality assessment.

## Step 1: Determine Scope and Depth

```
Recent changes: git diff --name-only HEAD~1
Specified files: review those directly

< 100 lines  → Quick Review  (~5 min)
100-500 lines → Standard Review (~15 min)
> 500 lines   → Comprehensive Review (~45 min)
```

## Step 2: Security Pass (ALWAYS FIRST)

### OWASP Top 10 Checklist

- [ ] **A01 Broken Access Control** — auth decorators present, ownership checks, no IDOR
- [ ] **A02 Cryptographic Failures** — secrets in env vars, passwords hashed, HTTPS enforced
- [ ] **A03 Injection** — parameterized queries, no f-strings/`.format()` in DB or shell calls
- [ ] **A04 Insecure Design** — deny-by-default logic, no missing threat model for new flows
- [ ] **A05 Security Misconfiguration** — debug off, security headers set, no default creds
- [ ] **A06 Vulnerable Components** — new deps audited (`npm audit` / `safety check` / `cargo audit`)
- [ ] **A07 Auth/Identity Failures** — sessions secure (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite), rate limits
- [ ] **A08 Software Integrity Failures** — no `pickle.loads(user_input)`, CI pipeline integrity safe
- [ ] **A09 Logging/Monitoring Failures** — security events logged, no secrets/PII in logs
- [ ] **A10 SSRF** — user-provided URLs validated, internal IPs blocked

### STRIDE (architectural changes and new service boundaries only)

- [ ] **S**poofing — identity verification in place for new services/APIs
- [ ] **T**ampering — data integrity checks, no unsigned/unverified updates
- [ ] **R**epudiation — audit trail exists for sensitive operations
- [ ] **I**nformation Disclosure — PII not leaked in logs, errors, or URLs
- [ ] **D**enial of Service — rate limits and resource caps on unbounded inputs
- [ ] **E**levation of Privilege — no unintended permission escalation path

### False Positive Annotation

Intentional exemptions: add `# nosec: <justification>` inline or a `# security-exempt: <reason>` comment block above the flagged section. Annotated exemptions are waived in the review report.

## Step 3: Code Quality

- File size > 800 lines → must flag for extraction
- Function/method > 100 lines → flag, suggest decomposition
- Naming: snake_case (Python), camelCase (JS/TS), PascalCase (classes)
- Error handling: bare `except:` or empty `catch {}` → flag
- Cyclomatic complexity: deeply nested blocks (> 4 levels) → flag

---

## Step 4: Reusability (HIGH priority)

- Logic duplicated 3+ times across files → extract to `lib/`
- Utility functions defined inline in multiple places → move to `lib/utils/`
- Magic numbers hardcoded → extract to `lib/config/constants`
- Does new code use existing shared modules, or re-implement them?

---

## Step 5: Performance

- N+1 query patterns in loops
- Unbounded DB queries (no LIMIT/pagination)
- Missing indexes on frequently-filtered columns
- Synchronous operations that should be async
- Unnecessary re-computation inside loops
- Missing caching on expensive repeated calls

---

## Step 6: Maintainability (Comprehensive only)

- Architecture alignment with SUBSYSTEMS.md boundaries
- Test coverage for changed code
- Documentation completeness (public API, complex logic)
- Technical debt introduced vs. resolved
- SOLID principle violations

---

## Step 7: Generate Review Report

```markdown
# Code Review: [Feature/Change Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope**: N files, N lines changed
**Depth**: Quick | Standard | Comprehensive
**Recommendation**: Approve | Request Changes | Comment

## 🔴 Security (CRITICAL — block merge)
- [Issue]: [File:line] — [Fix]

## 🟠 Security Findings (High/Medium/Low)
- **High** [A03 Injection]: [File:line] — [Fix]
- **Medium** [A05 Misconfiguration]: [File:line] — [Fix]
- **Low** [A09 Logging]: [File:line] — [Fix]

## 🟠 Quality Issues (should fix)
- [File] is NNN lines — extract [what] to [where]
- [Function] is NNN lines — decompose into [names]

## 🔵 Performance (consider fixing)
- [Pattern]: [Recommendation]

## 🟢 Reusability
- [Logic] duplicated in [file1] and [file2] — extract to lib/utils/
- [Constant] hardcoded — move to lib/config/constants

## ✅ Looks Good
- [What was done well]

## Action Items
- [ ] CRITICAL: [fix]
- [ ] Refactor: [what → where]
- [ ] Extract: [what → where]
```

---

## Step 8: Create Tasks for Critical Findings

- 🔴 Security CRITICAL → activate **g-skl-tasks CREATE** with `priority: critical`
- 🟠 File > 800 lines → activate **g-skl-tasks CREATE** as refactoring task
- 🟠 Duplicate logic (3-strike) → activate **g-skl-tasks CREATE** for extraction
