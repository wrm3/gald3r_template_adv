## When to Use
First-time setup of gald3r in a project. @g-setup command.

## Slim vs Full — Know Which You Are Installing

**This skill creates the SLIM layout.** Do not create the folders marked "full only" below.

| Folder | Slim | Full (gald3r_dev only) |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| `tasks/`, `bugs/`, `features/`, `subsystems/`, `reports/`, `logs/` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `config/` (HEARTBEAT.md, SPRINT.md, AGENT_CONFIG.md) | ❌ | ✅ |
| `experiments/` (EXPERIMENTS.md, HYPOTHESIS.md, SELF_EVOLUTION.md) | ❌ | ✅ |
| `linking/` (README.md, INBOX.md) | ❌ | ✅ |
| `vault/` | ❌ | ✅ |
| `phases/` (legacy v2) | ❌ | ✅ |

## Steps

### Step 0 — Workspace-Control member-repo guard (BUG-021 / Task 213 v1.1 / g-rl-36)

**Before any folder or file creation**, verify the target install path is not a Workspace-Control controlled_member or migration_source repository. `g-skl-setup` is for installing a full standalone gald3r project; member repositories use a marker-only `.gald3r/` shape that is owned by `g-wrkspc-spawn` / `g-wrkspc-adopt` plus the bootstrap helper, NOT full setup.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .gald3r_sys/skills/g-skl-workspace/scripts/check_member_repo_gald3r_guard.ps1 -TargetPath "<absolute_install_target>"
```

Outcomes:

- exit `0` (ALLOW) — target is the workspace control project, outside any workspace, or a template directory; proceed with full setup.
- exit `1` (BLOCK) — target is a Workspace-Control controlled_member or migration_source. **Stop**. Direct the user to either:
  1. Run setup against the workspace control project instead, OR
  2. Run `@g-wrkspc-spawn` (new empty member) or `@g-wrkspc-adopt` (existing standalone gald3r project) if the target should be a workspace member. Both paths use `.gald3r_sys/skills/g-skl-workspace/scripts/bootstrap_member_gald3r_marker.ps1` to create the marker pair (`.identity` + `PROJECT.md`) — they do NOT install the full gald3r control plane in members.
- exit `2` (ERROR) — manifest unparseable. Resolve before continuing. If the project is genuinely standalone (no `.gald3r/linking/workspace_manifest.yaml` in any ancestor), the helper returns ALLOW; an actual exit `2` indicates a broken manifest.

Installed projects ship the same helper at `.gald3r_sys/skills/g-skl-workspace/scripts/check_member_repo_gald3r_guard.ps1`. External template repos (`G:/gald3r_ecosystem/gald3r_template_slim`, `G:/gald3r_ecosystem/gald3r_template_full`, `G:/gald3r_ecosystem/gald3r_template_adv`) are the only legitimate exception for live `.gald3r/` writes outside the control project.

### Step 0.5 — Git Readiness Check

Run this after Step 0 passes and **before** any `.gald3r/` folder creation. Skip entirely if Step 0 blocked (member-repo targets do not need this check).

**1. Is this a git repo?**
```
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
```
- Exit 0 → repo exists, continue to check 2.
- Non-zero exit → not a git repo. Offer (default Y):
  ```
  "This directory is not a git repo. Initialize git? [Y/n]"
  → Y: git init && git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: initial commit"
  → N: warn "g-go-go autopilot requires git; some features will not work" then continue
  ```

**2. Does a `dev` branch exist?**
```
git branch --list dev
```
- Non-empty output → dev exists, skip.
- Empty → no dev branch. Offer (default Y):
  ```
  "No 'dev' branch found. Create dev from current HEAD? [Y/n]"
  → Y: git checkout -b dev
        [if remote exists] git push --set-upstream origin dev
        git checkout - (return to original branch)
  → N: warn "g-go-go autopilot will MERGE-BLOCKED without a dev branch"
  ```

**3. Remote check (info only — never blocks setup)**
```
git remote -v
```
- No remote configured → print info note only:
  `"No git remote configured. g-go-go autopilot cross-session merges require push access. Add later: git remote add origin <url>"`

**All prompts default to Y and are non-blocking** — declining any prompt adds a warning but does not stop the setup. The agent should present options as numbered choices in its response, then run the chosen commands.

### Step 1 — Detect if existing (check before creating anything)
   ```
   □ .gald3r/TASKS.md exists AND > 20 lines?
   □ .gald3r/tasks/ has > 5 files?
   □ PROJECT.md has non-template content?
   → YES: EXISTING project → ask: Merge / Skip / Reset (DESTRUCTIVE)
   → NO: FRESH install → proceed
   ```

2. **Call gald3r_install MCP tool** (if available):
   ```python
   gald3r_install(project_path="{absolute_path}", use_v2=True)
   ```

3. **If gald3r_install unavailable**, create manually:
   - Folders: `.gald3r/`, `.gald3r/tasks/`, `.gald3r/features/`, `.gald3r/bugs/`, `.gald3r/subsystems/`, `.gald3r/reports/`, `.gald3r/logs/`, `.gald3r/specifications_collection/`
   - Create `.gald3r/specifications_collection/README.md` with the index template (see template in `G:/gald3r_ecosystem/gald3r_template_full/.gald3r/specifications_collection/README.md`)
   - Create `.gald3r/learned-facts.md` from the template in `G:/gald3r_ecosystem/gald3r_template_full/.gald3r/learned-facts.md`
   - If `.gald3r/.identity` contains `vault_location`, create `{vault_location}/log.md` as a seed file (one header line — `append_log()` will populate it on first ingest)
   - If `.gald3r/.identity` contains `vault_location`, create `{vault_location}/projects/{project_name}/` directory; this is where `repos.txt` and `repo_tracker.json` will live when `github_sync.py` runs
   - If `.gald3r/.identity` contains `vault_location` **and** `{vault_location}/obsidian_setup.md` does not already exist, copy `G:/gald3r_ecosystem/gald3r_template_full/.gald3r/vault/obsidian_setup.md` (or the installed equivalent at `{skill_root}/reference/obsidian_setup.md`) to `{vault_location}/obsidian_setup.md`. This seeds the one-page Obsidian setup guide so vault users can find it immediately.
   - **Research-type projects:** when creating `TASKS.md`, add a research log section below the task list
   - Files: Use g-project (CREATE PROJECT.MD) and g-plan (CREATE PLAN.MD) for all file generation
   - Seed `CONSTRAINTS.md` with:
     1. The standard Governance section (including the Constraint Scope table)
     2. An empty Constraint Index table with columns: `ID | Status | Name | Scope | One-line summary`
     3. An empty Constraint Definitions section
     4. An empty Change Log table
     5. A comment block before the index explaining scope values:
        ```markdown
        <!-- CONSTRAINT SCOPE: local-only (default) | inheritable (propagate to children on spawn) | shareable (peers opt-in) | ecosystem-wide (all topology members) -->
        ```

3b. **Skill trust-level warning (C-032 — non-blocking)**: when the install bundles or copies any skills (template skill packs, adv-tier skill_packs), apply the same provenance check as `g-skill-pack-add` step 3b — surface a non-blocking warning for any skill whose `skill_trust_level:` is `community` or unset (trust level, source, `allowed-tools:` reminder, inspect-before-first-invocation). Slim setup ships only `core` skills, so this normally produces no warning; it fires when a non-core pack is added during or after setup. Canonical wording: `skl-skill-create/SKILL.md` → `### skill_trust_level:` declaration.

4. **Generate .identity**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())" > .gald3r/.identity
   ```

5. **Verify structure** (slim v3 layout — ground truth from G:\gald3r\.gald3r):
   ```
   .gald3r/ ✅
   ├── .identity ✅
   ├── .gitignore ✅
   ├── TASKS.md ✅
   ├── PLAN.md ✅                 ← master strategy (above PRDs)
   ├── PROJECT.md ✅             ← mission, goals, Project Linking
   ├── CONSTRAINTS.md ✅         ← non-negotiable constraints
   ├── BUGS.md ✅                ← bug index (root)
   ├── SUBSYSTEMS.md ✅
   ├── IDEA_BOARD.md ✅
   ├── FEATURES.md ✅                ← PRD index
   ├── learned-facts.md ✅       ← agent-captured learning (updated via /g-learn)
   ├── features/ ✅                  ← individual PRD files
   ├── bugs/ ✅                  ← optional per-bug detail files
   ├── reports/ ✅
   ├── logs/ ✅
   ├── subsystems/ ✅            ← per-subsystem spec files
   ├── specifications_collection/ ✅  ← incoming specs from stakeholders
   └── tasks/ ✅
   docs/ ✅
   ```

   > **NOT in slim:** `config/`, `experiments/`, `linking/`, `vault/`, `phases/`
   > These belong in `gald3r_dev` only. Do not create them here.
   > **When `linking/` IS created** (full tier): also seed `.gald3r/linking/capabilities.md` using the template at `G:/gald3r_ecosystem/gald3r_template_full/.gald3r/linking/capabilities.md`. Replace `{project_slug}` and `{project_name}` placeholders with the actual project name. Replace `{YYYY-MM-DD}` with today's date.

6. **Create PROJECT.MD scaffolding**:
   - `.gald3r/PROJECT.md` — include a **Project Linking** section (parents, children, siblings); starts with `relationships: none`

7. **Subsystem Discovery** (run after folder creation):
   Scan the project to identify subsystems. For each, create a spec file in `.gald3r/subsystems/`:
   
   **What to scan:**
   - Top-level directories and `src/` subdirectories → candidate subsystems
   - Database schema files → table groups suggest subsystems
   - Config files → each config suggests a consuming subsystem
   - API route files → each route group suggests a subsystem
   - Docker services → each container is likely its own subsystem
   - External service integrations → integration entries in host subsystem
   
   **For each identified subsystem, create spec with:**
   ```yaml
   locations:
     code: [source file paths]
     skills: [relevant gald3r skills]
     agents: [relevant gald3r agents]
     commands: [relevant gald3r commands]
     config: [config files]
     db_tables: [owned tables]
   ```
   Plus: Responsibility, Data Flow, Architecture Rules, When to Modify sections.
   
   **Classify as:**
   - **Subsystem** (own code + state + lifecycle) → top-level entry + spec file
   - **Sub-feature** (shares parent's code/state) → documented in parent spec
   - **Integration** (external adapter) → listed in host subsystem spec
   
   Update SUBSYSTEMS.md with the index table, sub-features table, integrations table, and mermaid interconnection graph.

8. **Write skills lock file** (T1043 / IDEA-HARVEST-136):
   After platform skill directories are placed (whether by `gald3r_install` MCP, by `bin/install.js`, or manually), write `gald3r-skills-lock.json` at project root via:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\gald3r_skills_lock.ps1 -Action WRITE -ProjectPath . -Tier <slim|full|adv>
   ```
   - Records SHA-256 hash of each installed `SKILL.md` so future runs can detect tamper / drift.
   - Pair with `-Action VERIFY` during `gald3r_validate.ps1` runs.
   - Pair with `-Action UPGRADE -SourceRoot <gald3r_dev path>` to classify each installed skill as `unchanged | local-modified | upstream-changed | both-changed | new | removed` before pulling a new gald3r version.
   - Lock file format and operations documented in `docs/SKILLS_LOCK_FORMAT.md`.

8b. **Codebase Graph Initialization (gald3r_muninn, T1149)** — non-blocking, always optional:
   - Check index state via `graph_status` (MCP) or `.gald3r_sys/skills/g-skl-muninn/scripts/graph_impact.ps1 -File <any source file> -Json`. If it reports `index_missing` / `warning: not_indexed`, offer to build it now:
     ```powershell
     python -m docker.gald3r.tools.plugins.muninn.indexers.python_indexer --root .   # Python sources
     node  docker/gald3r/tools/plugins/muninn/indexers/ts_indexer.js  --root .       # TS/JS sources (needs Node.js)
     ```
     The gald3r_muninn indexers run **natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux** (clean-room rewrite — no WSL2/Docker required, unlike the deprecated GitNexus). If Python or Node.js is missing, skip that indexer and continue — setup never blocks on graph init, and if the user declines the index simply stays absent (g-go-code Step b0 falls back to ripgrep).
   - **Auto-wire the post-commit refresh hook** (idempotent, after user confirmation) so the index stays fresh:

     **PowerShell (Windows — native):**
     ```powershell
     $hookFile = ".git/hooks/post-commit"
     # use the active platform's hook path (.cursor/hooks/, .claude/hooks/, ...)
     $hookLine = "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .cursor/hooks/g-hk-graph-update.ps1"
     $existing = if (Test-Path $hookFile) { Get-Content $hookFile -Raw } else { "" }
     if ($existing -notlike "*$hookLine*") { Add-Content -Path $hookFile -Value $hookLine }
     ```

     **Bash (Linux / macOS / Git Bash on Windows):**
     ```bash
     HOOK_FILE=".git/hooks/post-commit"
     # use the active platform's hook path (.cursor/hooks/, .claude/hooks/, ...)
     HOOK_LINE="powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .cursor/hooks/g-hk-graph-update.ps1"
     grep -qF "$HOOK_LINE" "$HOOK_FILE" 2>/dev/null || { printf '%s\n' "$HOOK_LINE" >> "$HOOK_FILE"; chmod +x "$HOOK_FILE"; }
     ```
     Re-running setup does not duplicate the line; the hook exits 0 on all platforms even if indexing fails. See the **Codebase Graph (gald3r_muninn)** section below.

9. **Print next steps**:
   - Review `.gald3r/PROJECT.md` and confirm mission and goals
   - Review SUBSYSTEMS.md and adjust detected components
   - Review subsystem spec files in `.gald3r/subsystems/` for accuracy
   - Create first task with @g-tasks (CREATE) (sequential task IDs)
   - Draft or refine `.gald3r/PLAN.md` and Feature under `features/` as needed
   - Declare cross-project relationships in **Project Linking** (`@g-project (Project Linking section)`) when ready
   - **Optional**: Install domain-specific skill packs from `skill_packs/` directory — run `.\skill_packs\{pack}\install.ps1` for infrastructure, ai-ml-dev, startup-tools, and other packs

## Codebase Graph (gald3r_muninn)

The codebase graph (gald3r_muninn) indexes Python and TypeScript/JavaScript source so `g-go-code` **Step b0 Impact Scan** can answer "what breaks if I change this file?" with real import/call edges instead of a linear grep. It is **optional** — when absent, Step b0 falls back to ripgrep (non-blocking).

**What it does**: builds a local SQLite graph at `~/.gald3r/muninn.db` (override with `MUNINN_DB_PATH`). `graph_impact` / `graph_callers` / `graph_callees` / `graph_deps` / `graph_status` query it.

**How to initialize** (step 8b above): run the Python + TypeScript indexers once, then let the post-commit hook (`g-hk-graph-update.ps1`) refresh changed files on every commit.

**OS support matrix** (clean-room rewrite — supersedes the WSL-only GitNexus):

| OS | Python indexer | TypeScript indexer | Notes |
|----|----------------|--------------------|-------|
| Windows | ✅ native | ✅ native (needs Node.js) | No WSL2/Docker required |
| macOS | ✅ native | ✅ native (needs Node.js) | — |
| Linux | ✅ native | ✅ native (needs Node.js) | — |

If a runtime (Python / Node.js) is missing, skip that indexer — the graph simply indexes the languages it can, and Step b0 falls back to ripgrep for the rest. Initialization, the post-commit hook, and the `gald3r_install` post-install offer are all non-blocking.
