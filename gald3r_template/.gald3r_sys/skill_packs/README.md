# Skill Packs

Skill packs are optional add-on skill collections not part of gald3r core. Users can
install none, some, or all packs simultaneously.

## Commands

```
g-skill-pack-list               List all packs and install status
g-skill-pack-add <pack> [skill] Install a full pack or single skill
g-skill-pack-del <pack> [skill] Remove a pack or single skill
g-skill-pack-save <skill>       Save evolved skill back to pack registry
```

## Architecture

Each pack stores a single canonical copy in ``:

```
<pack-name>/
  source/
    skills/        ← one subfolder per skill, same as gald3r core skills
  PACK.md          ← version, tier, skill list
  install.ps1      ← platform-aware installer
```

## Evolved Skills

If you customize a skill, rename your version to `<skill-name>_evolved/` in your IDE folder.
`g-skill-pack-del` will skip `_evolved` skills (warns instead of deleting).
`g-skill-pack-save` packages your evolved version back into the registry.
